AryaStrata inherits Strata and PolyStrata’s local inference engines, installer, web chat,
live resource monitor, and compatible APIs. It shares model work across GPU memory,
system RAM, CPU and storage so large mixture-of-experts models can run on a PC.
Our focus is coding agents, AryaAI development integration, and reproducible results
on the hardware below. Models run locally; connected clients and tools have their
own network behavior.

## Supported models

The inherited installer includes nine model families across the original Strata
engine and PolyStrata’s additional `strata-poly` engine. Support in the codebase
does not mean every model, quantization or platform has been tested on our PC.
The linked guides retain upstream measurements, hardware requirements and limitations.

| Model family | Engine / inherited platform path | Image input | AryaStrata host status | Guide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Qwen3.8-Flash-Next** | Strata; NVIDIA/AMD, Windows/Linux with platform-specific limits | Yes | **IQ3_XXS running and tuned; text/coding benchmarked; GPU vision smoke-tested** | [Models and variants](docs/MODELS.md) |

Qwen3.8 variants include **Coder, Swift 1.5, and Unsloth quantizations**. These are
inherited options; our results apply to the exact IQ3_XXS files in the benchmark
record. Linux AMD beta paths, Apple Silicon, Intel Arc and multi-GPU work have
separate scope: [AMD](docs/AMD_HIP.md), [Mac](docs/MAC.md),
[Intel](docs/INTEL.md), [multiple GPUs](docs/MULTI_GPU.md). None is qualified by
our single-NVIDIA Windows results. Image support means understanding image input;
[optional image generation](docs/IMAGES.md) is a separate model and is not enabled
by turning Qwen vision on. Model weights retain their own licenses.


## Our host

| Component | Hardware |
| --- | --- |
| CPU | Intel Core i9-14900KF, 24 cores / 32 threads |
| GPU | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER, 16 GB VRAM |
| RAM | 64 GB installed, 63.82 GiB reported by Windows |
| Storage | WD Blue SN580 2 TB SSD |
| OS | Windows 11 Home |

## Measured on this host

Qwen3.8-Flash-Next **IQ3_XXS**, upstream release engine **0.1.45**, native Windows.
The selected profile restores the old **262,144-token context ceiling**, with int8
KV, 32K resident KV, a 1,792 MiB VRAM reserve, MTP and 15 CPU expert workers.
Vision was off for this benchmark suite. GPU vision is now enabled; these text
results have not been remeasured with the image encoder loaded. These are host
settings, not universal defaults.

October 17, 2026 results (medians):

| Metric | New-install baseline at 262K | Tuned at 262K |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Short-chat generation | 76.4 tokens/s | **86.1 tokens/s** |
| Short-chat first token | 0.447 s | **0.368 s** |
| Agent-style generation | 86.8 tokens/s | **95.6 tokens/s** |
| Agent-style follow-up first token | 2.105 s | 2.122 s |
| Fresh 32K prompt processing | 2,933.7 tokens/s | 2,915.0 tokens/s |

The observed short-chat median improved **12.7%**; prompt processing and follow-up
latency were largely unchanged. These are small, workload-specific comparisons
with overlapping run ranges, not a comparison against the old engine binary.
Agent-style speed sessions summarize files; correctness is tested separately.

- **18/18 bounded coding-agent sessions passed**: three Python fixtures, three
  runs each with thinking off and with low thinking, including read/edit/test tools.
- **3/3 development DSH adapter trials passed**: streaming tool calls and tool-result replay.
- **12/12 recall trials passed** across about 32K, 65K, 131K and **258,300 actual
  input tokens**. The largest inputs took a median **101.6 seconds to first token**.

These checks do not establish general repository-level coding quality or a fully
qualified native desktop workflow. Raw records, ranges, exact model/build hashes,
resource observations and methodology: [full host benchmark](bench/results/2026-10-17-aryastrata-qwen38-iq3xxs/README.md).

[Current host setup](docs/ARYASTRATA.md) · [AryaAI development DSH profile](docs/ARYAAI_DSH.md)

Additional full-context host results: [Qwen3.6 Q4 versus Q8](docs/QWEN36_HOST_RESULTS.md)
and [MiniCPM-V 4.7 Q4 with vision](docs/MINICPMV_HOST_RESULTS.md). The MiniCPM
report uses corrected coding-validator results and retains the original records
for audit; its speed, image and recall results are separate measurements.

### Current vision and agent configuration

Qwen now accepts **text and images** through the chat API, with the GPU image
encoder enabled and up to **1,024 image tokens per picture**. The context ceiling
remains 262,144 tokens. A synthetic image check correctly identified two shapes,
their colors and positions, and the text `VISION 7319` in **2.11 seconds**
([image and raw response](bench/results/2026-10-17-aryastrata-qwen38-vision/README.md)).
This is one smoke check; broader vision accuracy and the native AryaAI attachment
workflow still need testing.

The AryaAI development profile advertises text/image input and an **8,192-token
output capability**. Context is a total input-plus-output budget: the 258,300-token
recall test used only a 128-token output allowance, not an 8K answer.


## Run on this host

Start `run-iq3_xxs.bat` from this folder when the server is stopped. Setup generated
that launcher locally; it reuses the preserved downloads under `C:\AI\Strata-data`.

- Chat: [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).
- OpenAI-compatible base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`.
- Model: `qwen3.8-flash-next-iq3_xxs`.
- Keep the server on `127.0.0.1`; access from other devices requires an API key.

For a fresh installation, follow [installation](docs/INSTALL.md) or
[assistant setup instructions](docs/AI_SETUP.md). Other models and hardware paths
are inherited capabilities; they still need validation on this host.

## Upstream reference benchmarks

The original Strata and PolyStrata measurements below are retained as historical
reference with their original machines and methods. They are not measurements
from this host or controlled comparisons against our Qwen configuration. We will
add host results for each model as validation is completed.

A token is about ¾ of a word.

- **Writes answers:** how fast the reply appears in a short chat. 60 tokens per second is faster than you can read.
- **Reads your prompt:** how fast it takes in what you send (a document, code or a chat history).

### Qwen3.8-Flash-Next

Measured by the Strata project on two ordinary gaming PCs, with a 32K-token prompt.

On the laptop Q8_0 fills the 32 GB of RAM, which is what makes it slow there; the workstation holds every size
whole.

With `--n-cpu-moe 25`, the best of the settings tried on the laptop, llama.cpp b11540 read a prompt of 32,000 tokens
there at 530 tokens/s and wrote after it at 53; PolyStrata read it at 3,540 and wrote at 71 to 73. On the workstation
llama-bench read 29,816 tokens at 13,300 tokens/s with llama.cpp's default batch of 512 and at 23,600 with 2,048, as
fast as PolyStrata, and wrote one token at a time at 455 tokens/s and at 369 after that prompt, where PolyStrata
writes at 452 and 387. A prompt of about 124,000 tokens in a 128K context was read and answered in 8.7 seconds on the
workstation; the laptop read it in 45 seconds.

### Qwen3.6-35B-A3B

The eight models of PolyStrata's own engine were measured with its benchmark, which you can run on your PC:
`python polystrata.py benchmark --model <name> --prompt-tokens 24000`
([what it sends and prints](docs/BACKENDS.md#benchmark)).
What others measured on their own cards, and how to compare with llama.cpp on yours:
[community results](docs/COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md#the-models-polystrata-adds).
On the laptop PolyStrata read prompts 2.7 to 3.5 times as fast as llama.cpp b11540 and wrote 1.5 to 1.8 times
as fast, with Qwen3.6 and with Tiel Coder ([the two runs](docs/COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md#comparing-with-llamacpp)).

## Hardware requirements

These are inherited requirements, installer estimates and upstream test coverage,
not additional AryaStrata host qualifications. In particular, the large GLM and
DeepSeek configurations need more RAM than our 64 GB host for the documented
in-memory setups. Check each model guide before downloading.

### Qwen3.8-Flash-Next

| **Graphics card** | **NVIDIA** GeForce RTX 20, 30, 40 or 50 series, or **AMD** Radeon RX 7900 XT / XTX, RX 7800 XT / 7700 XT, RX 9060 XT, RX 9070 / 9070 XT, Radeon AI PRO R9700 or RX 6800 / 6900 series. It needs **12 GB of VRAM or more**. |
| **RAM** | 32 GB or more. Your RAM decides [which size](#which-model-should-i-pick) fits. 64 GB runs every size. |
| **Disk** | About 80 GB free. Use an SSD if you can: the first start is much faster. |
| **System** | Windows 10 / 11 or Linux, and a current graphics driver from NVIDIA or AMD. |

The installer sets up everything else. Two or three cards can share the model ([multi-GPU](docs/MULTI_GPU.md)).

Experimental, written and tested by community members on their own machines:

- **Older graphics cards** (Tesla P40 / V100, GTX 10, Radeon VII / MI50, RX 6700 XT, RX 5500 XT): [Older GPUs](docs/OLDER_GPUS.md).
- **Intel Arc**, built from source on Linux: [Intel Arc](docs/INTEL_ARC.md).
- **Apple Silicon Macs (M1 to M5)**, built from source by `./setup.sh` (the Metal engine): [Mac](docs/MAC.md).
- **AMD Ryzen AI Max (Strix Halo)**, built from source on Linux: [Strix Halo](docs/STRIX_HALO.md).
- **Older processors without AVX2**: they work, but slowly. [Older CPUs](docs/INSTALL.md#older-cpus-experimental).

| **Graphics card** | One **NVIDIA** GeForce RTX 20 series card or newer. It has run on **32 GB of VRAM** only. About 12 GB are taken before any expert, so a 12 GB card cannot start it. |
| **RAM** | Beside a 32 GB card, **96 GB or more** for the whole model, 82 GB for its 2-bit size, 60 GB for the size with half the experts. A smaller card needs more RAM ([how much](#which-model-should-i-pick)). It has run with 120 GB. |
| **Disk** | 114 GB, 102 GB or 79 GB for the model file, on an SSD. |
| **System** | Linux, and a current NVIDIA driver. |

The installer sets up everything else. It compiles the engine on your PC and offers to install what that needs
(g++ and the CUDA toolkit). Not yet: AMD cards, two cards on Windows, three cards or more, pictures.
A user runs it on Windows with one 24 GB card and 128 GB of RAM ([report](https://github.com/KonnectSuite/AryaStrata/issues/10)).

### DeepSeek V4 Flash

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Graphics card** | One **NVIDIA** GeForce RTX 20 series card or newer. It has run on **32 GB of VRAM** only. About 11.5 GB are taken before any expert, so a 12 GB card cannot start it. |
| **RAM** | Beside a 32 GB card, **72 GB or more**, the installer's estimate. A smaller card needs more RAM ([how much](#which-model-should-i-pick)). It has run with 120 GB. |
| **Disk** | 91 GB for the model's three files, on an SSD. |
| **System** | Linux, and a current NVIDIA driver. |

The installer sets up everything else, as it does for GLM 5.3 Flash. Not tried yet: AMD cards, two cards.
It reads text only. A user runs it on Windows with one 24 GB card and 128 GB of RAM ([report](https://github.com/KonnectSuite/AryaStrata/issues/21)).

### LFM2.5-24B-A2B

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Graphics card** | One **NVIDIA** GeForce RTX 20 series card or newer with **8 GB of VRAM or more**. About 4 GB are taken before any expert. It has run on a laptop's 8 GB card and on a 32 GB card. |
| **RAM** | About **16, 18, 20, 27 or 31 GB** beside an 8 GB card for UD-Q3_K_XL, QAD-Q4_0, UD-Q4_K_XL, UD-Q6_K_XL and Q8_0, the installer's estimate. A card with 24 GB holds the three smaller sizes whole. All five have run on a laptop with 32 GB. |
| **Disk** | 11 to 25 GB for the model file. |
| **System** | Linux or Windows 10 / 11, and a current NVIDIA driver. |

The installer sets up everything else, as for Qwen3.6-35B-A3B below. It has not been tried on an AMD card. It reads
text only. Liquid AI's license allows commercial use only to companies with less than 10 million dollars of yearly
revenue ([LFM Open License v1.0](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-24B-A2B/blob/main/LICENSE)).

### Qwen3.6-35B-A3B

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Graphics card** | One **NVIDIA** GeForce RTX 20 series card or newer with **8 GB of VRAM or more**. About 5 GB are taken before any expert. It has run on a 32 GB card, on that card held to 8 GB, and on a laptop's 8 GB card. On Linux an AMD card can run it as a beta: setup compiles the engine on your PC; tested so far with Qwen3.6 and Ornith on an RX 7600. |
| **RAM** | About **17, 21 or 27 GB** beside an 8 GB card for the three sizes, the installer's estimate. A card with 24 GB holds the two smaller sizes whole. All three sizes have run on a laptop with 32 GB. |
| **Disk** | 13, 17 or 23 GB for the model file, 1 GB more to read pictures. |
| **System** | Linux or Windows 10 / 11, and a current NVIDIA driver. |

The installer sets up everything else, as it does for GLM 5.3 Flash. On Windows it downloads the engine ready-made
from the latest release. On a processor without AVX2, or in a copy whose engine changed after that release, it
compiles the engine instead with Visual Studio's 2022 compiler and the CUDA toolkit, and offers to install them. Not
yet: AMD cards on Windows, two cards on Windows, three cards or more.

Since its 0.1.44 the [Strata](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata) project's own engine runs Qwen3.6 too, from UD-Q4_K_XL up
(`--family qwen36-strata`, 32 GB of RAM or more). On an RTX 5090 with UD-Q4_K_XL it read a 4K prompt 1.6 times as fast
as strata-poly; a 31K prompt and writing came out about even ([measured](docs/BACKENDS.md#qwen36-on-two-engines)). The smaller sizes, for
8 GB cards, stay on strata-poly.

### Ornith 1.5

On Linux an AMD card can run it as a beta: setup compiles the engine on your PC; tested so far with Qwen3.6 and Ornith on an RX 7600. |
| **RAM** | About **18, 22 or 28 GB** beside an 8 GB card for the three sizes, the installer's estimate. A card with 24 GB holds the two smaller sizes whole. All three sizes have run on a laptop with 32 GB. |
| **Disk** | 14, 17 or 24 GB for the model file, 1 GB more to read pictures. |
| **System** | Linux or Windows 10 / 11, and a current NVIDIA driver. |

The installer sets up everything else, as it does for GLM 5.3 Flash. On Windows it downloads the engine ready-made

## Install

### Let your AI set it up

Do you use an AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, ...)? Paste this into it:

```text
Set up AryaStrata on this PC for me: https://github.com/KonnectSuite/AryaStrata - follow docs/AI_SETUP.md in that repository.
```

It checks your graphics card, RAM and disk and picks the model that fits. Then it installs and starts it and tells
you how to connect your apps. AI tools can also install, start and stop AryaStrata through its
[MCP server](docs/MCP_SERVER.md).

### Or do it yourself

[Download AryaStrata](https://github.com/KonnectSuite/AryaStrata/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it (or `git clone` it).
**Windows:** double-click **`START-HERE.bat`**. **Linux:** run **`./setup.sh`** in the AryaStrata folder.

**Mac (Apple Silicon, M1 to M5, macOS 15 or newer):** install Apple's Command Line Tools once
(`xcode-select --install` in Terminal; Xcode itself is not needed). Then open Terminal in the AryaStrata folder and run
**`./setup.sh`**. It builds the Mac engine on your Mac (about 7 minutes), asks the same questions, downloads the model
and starts it. Next time, `./setup.sh` starts it right away. Which size fits your Mac and how fast it is:
[docs/MAC.md](docs/MAC.md).

The installer finds your card and sets up the right engine for it. It asks you a few questions:

- which model and which size,
- how much context (how much text the model keeps in mind),
- whether it should read pictures (GLM 5.3 Flash, DeepSeek V4 Flash and LFM2.5 read none).

Press Enter each time for the recommended answer. Then it downloads the model (about 70 GB for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next,
79 to 114 GB for GLM 5.3 Flash, 91 GB for DeepSeek V4 Flash, 11 to 29 GB for the other six) and starts it. If the download stops, run it again:
it continues where it left off. Your browser opens the AryaStrata app at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

All nine are in the installer's list of models. `./setup.sh --family glm`, `deepseek`, `lfm25`, `qwen36`, `ornith`,
`gemma4`, `tiel` or `minicpmv` goes straight to one ([what it asks and writes](docs/GLM.md#install)).

> **While the model starts, your PC can be slow or stop responding for 1-3 minutes** (longest the first time).
> AryaStrata loads 35-55 GB into your RAM and locks part of it for the graphics card. This is normal. Wait, and don't
> close the window. The window shows what AryaStrata is doing.

**Next time**, run `START-HERE.bat` (or `./setup.sh`) again. It starts right away and downloads nothing twice. Close
its window to stop the model. `UPDATE.bat` (`./update.sh`) updates AryaStrata without starting it. Updating, Docker,
several cards, where the files go and every option: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

**Is it fast on your PC?** Run `BENCH.bat` (`./bench.sh`): about 5-10 minutes, it measures chat, 4K/16K prompts and an agent-style session with your own settings and writes a report to share ([how](docs/COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md#run-the-benchmark)).

## Which model should I pick?

The guidance below preserves the upstream model choices and sizing estimates.
For this host, IQ3_XXS is the configuration measured above; other sizes and model
families have not yet received the same validation.

### Qwen3.8-Flash-Next

The installer recommends one for your RAM. The same model comes in several sizes, compressed more or less. Smaller
sizes are faster. Larger sizes are a bit smarter.

| Your RAM | Take | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **32 GB** | **Coder** | it fits 32 GB, and it is made for code (with a 24 GB card, Q2_0 and IQ2_XS run too) |
| **48 GB** | **IQ2_XS** (or Q2_0, the fastest) | the larger sizes do not fit |
| **64 GB** | **IQ2_XS** (recommended), or IQ3_XXS / IQ3_S | every size fits; IQ3_S is the best and the slowest |
| **96 GB or more** | **IQ3_S**, or Unsloth's UD-IQ4_XS (~4-bit) | room for the largest sizes with everything else open |

- **[Coder](docs/MODELS.md#coder):** a coding version with half of the experts removed. It reaches 91% of the full
  model's SWE-bench Verified score (measured by its authors) and fits 32 GB of RAM. It is weaker outside code,
  including Chinese and other CJK text (#438). For those, take Q2_0, IQ2_XS or IQ3_S, which keep every expert.
- **[Swift 1.5](docs/MODELS.md#swift-15):** a fine-tune that thinks for a much shorter time before it answers. You
  get the answer sooner, at about the same quality.
- **[Unsloth UD-IQ4_XS](docs/MODELS.md#unsloth-ud-iq4_xs):** Unsloth's ~4-bit version, between IQ3_S and
  UD-Q4_K_XL in quality. A 94 GB download. With less than ~80 GB of RAM, AryaStrata reads part of it from the SSD
  while it answers, so it is slower there (an NVMe SSD helps).
- **[Unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL, UD-Q5_K_XL, UD-Q6_K_XL and Q8_0](docs/MODELS.md#unsloths-files-ud-iq4_xs-to-q8_0):**
  4- to 8-bit, closer to the full model (93-95% the same next token as Q8_0). Fast where every expert fits in RAM
  (~88 GB for UD-Q4_K_XL up to ~136 GB for Q8_0); with less RAM AryaStrata reads part of them from the SSD while it
  answers, which is much slower (7-8.5 tokens/s for UD-Q4_K_XL on a 64 GB PC).
- **[OrcaRouter's Uncensored IQ3_XXS](docs/MODELS.md#orcarouter-uncensored-iq3_xxs):** you set it up by hand. It is
  not in the installer's menu.

Sizes, downloads and what fits where: [docs/MODELS.md](docs/MODELS.md). To add another model later, run
`SETUP.bat` (Linux: `./setup.sh --setup`).

### GLM 5.3 Flash

Three sizes so far. The installer takes the first one your RAM is enough for.

| Size | What it is | Download | RAM beside a 32 GB card |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| **3.0BIT** | the whole model, at about 3 bits ([neuralll](https://huggingface.co/neuralll/GLM-5.3-Flash-GSQ-RCO-3.0bit-Q4Kattn-GGUF)) | 114 GB | 96 GB |
| **UD-IQ2_XXS** | the whole model, at about 2 bits ([Unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-5.3-Flash-GGUF)): it reads a prompt faster and writes more slowly | 102 GB | 82 GB |
| **REAP50-Q3_K_M** | half of the routed experts removed ([REAP50](https://huggingface.co/patrickbdevaney/GLM-5.3-Flash-REAP50-GGUF) by patrickbdevaney) | 79 GB | 60 GB |

Your graphics card decides how much RAM it needs, because the experts the card does not hold have to stay in RAM.

| Your graphics card | 3.0BIT | UD-IQ2_XXS | REAP50-Q3_K_M | |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| **32 GB** | **96 GB** | **82 GB** | **60 GB** | the PC it has run on (120 GB of RAM) |
| **24 GB** | about 104 GB | about 90 GB | about 68 GB | not run yet |
| **16 GB** | about 113 GB | about 99 GB | about 77 GB | not run yet |
| **12 GB or less** | | | | it does not start |

The RAM numbers are the installer's estimate from the one PC it has run on. With less RAM it still starts, but it
reads experts from the SSD while it answers and gets much slower. The installer says so and asks first.

Other quantizations of GLM 5.3 Flash are not supported yet: [what is missing](docs/GLM.md#what-is-missing).

### DeepSeek V4 Flash

One size so far.

| Size | What it is | Download | RAM beside a 32 GB card |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| **UD-IQ2_XXS** | the whole model at about 2 bits ([Unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-GGUF)) | 91 GB | 72 GB |

As with GLM 5.3 Flash, the experts the card does not hold stay in RAM: about 80 GB beside a 24 GB card and 89 GB
beside a 16 GB card, by the installer's estimate, and a 12 GB card cannot start it. Only the 32 GB card has been
tried.

### LFM2.5-24B-A2B

Five sizes. The installer takes UD-Q4_K_XL, or UD-Q3_K_XL when the PC has too little RAM for it. The others are
chosen by name: `--model QAD-Q4_0`.

| Size | What it is | Download | RAM beside an 8 GB card |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| **UD-Q4_K_XL** | the whole model with 4-bit experts ([Unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/LFM2.5-24B-A2B-GGUF)) | 15 GB | about 20 GB |
| **UD-Q3_K_XL** | the same with 3-bit experts: the least RAM | 11 GB | about 16 GB |
| **QAD-Q4_0** | 4-bit, from [Liquid AI](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-24B-A2B-GGUF), trained to lose less to that quantization | 14 GB | about 18 GB |
| **UD-Q6_K_XL** | 6-bit experts | 22 GB | about 27 GB |
| **Q8_0** | 8-bit throughout, the closest to the model as trained | 25 GB | about 31 GB |

Against Q8_0, on five prompts of 256 tokens each, the other sizes pick Q8_0's most likely token at 96.8% of the steps
(UD-Q6_K_XL), 95.5% (UD-Q4_K_XL), 92.7% (QAD-Q4_0) and 91.6% (UD-Q3_K_XL).

### Qwen3.6-35B-A3B

Three sizes so far. The installer takes UD-Q3_K_M, or UD-Q2_K_XL when the PC has too little RAM for it. UD-Q4_K_M is chosen by name: `--model UD-Q4_K_M`.

| Size | What it is | Download | RAM beside an 8 GB card |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| **UD-Q3_K_M** | the whole model with 3-bit experts ([Unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MTP-GGUF)) | 17 GB | about 21 GB |
| **UD-Q2_K_XL** | the same with 2- and 3-bit experts: the least RAM | 13 GB | about 17 GB |
| **UD-Q4_K_M** | the same with 4-bit experts | 23 GB | about 27 GB |

A larger card holds more of the model and needs less RAM: with UD-Q3_K_M about 17 GB beside a 12 GB card, 13 GB beside a 16 GB
card, and 10 GB once the card holds all of it. These are the installer's estimates. They have not been checked on
such a PC.

### Ornith 1.5

Three sizes so far. The installer takes APEX-I-COMPACT, or APEX-I-MINI when the PC has too little RAM for it. APEX-I-QUALITY is chosen by name: `--model APEX-I-QUALITY`.

| Size | What it is | Download | RAM beside an 8 GB card |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| **APEX-I-COMPACT** | the whole model with 3- and 4-bit experts ([APEX](https://huggingface.co/mudler/Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B-APEX-MTP-GGUF) by mudler) | 17 GB | about 22 GB |
| **APEX-I-MINI** | the same with 2- and 3-bit experts: the least RAM | 14 GB | about 18 GB |
| **APEX-I-QUALITY** | the same with 4- to 6-bit experts | 24 GB | about 28 GB |

A larger card holds more of the model and needs less RAM: with APEX-I-COMPACT about 17 GB beside a 12 GB card, 13 GB beside a 16 GB
card, and 10 GB once the card holds all of it. These are the installer's estimates. They have not been checked on
such a PC.

### Gemma 4 26B-A4B

Three sizes so far. The installer takes UD-Q3_K_M, or UD-Q2_K_XL when the PC has too little RAM for it. UD-Q4_K_M is chosen by name: `--model UD-Q4_K_M`.

| Size | What it is | Download | RAM beside an 8 GB card |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| **UD-Q3_K_M** | the whole model with 3-bit experts ([Unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF)), and Google's draft model for it | 13 GB | about 18 GB |
| **UD-Q2_K_XL** | the same with 2-bit experts: the least RAM | 11 GB | about 15 GB |
| **UD-Q4_K_M** | the same with 4- and 5-bit experts | 17 GB | about 21 GB |

A larger card holds more of the model and needs less RAM: with UD-Q3_K_M about 14 GB beside a 12 GB card, and 10 GB once the card
holds all of it. These are the installer's estimates. They have not been checked on such a PC.

### Tiel Coder 35B-A3B

Three sizes so far. The installer takes UD-Q3_K_XL, or UD-IQ3_XXS when the PC has too little RAM for it. UD-Q4_K_XL is chosen by name: `--model UD-Q4_K_XL`.

| Size | What it is | Download | RAM beside an 8 GB card |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| **UD-Q3_K_XL** | the whole model with 3- and 4-bit experts ([peculiar-ragdoll](https://huggingface.co/peculiar-ragdoll/Tiel-Coder-35B-A3B-GGUF-MTP)) | 17 GB | about 21 GB |
| **UD-IQ3_XXS** | the same with 2- and 3-bit experts: the least RAM | 14 GB | about 18 GB |
| **UD-Q4_K_XL** | the same with 4- to 6-bit experts | 23 GB | about 27 GB |

A larger card holds more of the model and needs less RAM: with UD-Q3_K_XL about 17 GB beside a 12 GB card, 13 GB beside a 16 GB
card, and 10 GB once the card holds all of it. These are the installer's estimates. They have not been checked on
such a PC.

### MiniCPM-V 4.7 35B-A3B

Three sizes so far, from OpenBMB. The installer takes Q4_K_M, or mix_q3gud_im when the PC has too little RAM for it.
Q6_K is chosen by name: `--model Q6_K`.

| Size | What it is | Download | RAM beside an 8 GB card |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| **Q4_K_M** | the whole model with 4-bit experts ([OpenBMB](https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4.7-35B-A3B-gguf)) | 21 GB | about 25 GB |
| **mix_q3gud_im** | the same with 3- and 4-bit experts: the least RAM | 16 GB | about 19 GB |
| **Q6_K** | the same with 6-bit experts | 29 GB | about 31 GB |

    ([setup](docs/DETAILS.md#the-responses-api-and-codex-cli)).
- **Thinking:** choose **off, low, medium or high** in the chat menu or in your app's "reasoning effort". Off is the
  fastest. High is best for hard questions.
- **From your phone or another PC:** `START-HERE.bat --setup --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key <secret>`. Always set a key.

The following behavior and platform differences are inherited from the upstream
engines. Timing examples in this table refer to upstream machines; our measured
32K prompt took about 11 seconds and our largest recall prompt about 102 seconds
to first token.

### Optional: more speed on one card when the whole model fits in RAM

These options have not been benchmarked in our selected host profile.

Two opt-in settings (by RubenTorney, #1904 and #1905). They help when you run one graphics card and your RAM holds
every expert (AryaStrata's arena mode, for example Q2_0 or IQ3_XXS on a 64 GB PC). Open your config,
`strata-<model>.json` in the AryaStrata data folder ([where](docs/INSTALL.md#where-things-are-stored)), and add:

- **Faster decode:** `"--adapt-async", "1"` to the `"args"` list. The expert cache then updates on a helper thread
  instead of pausing the answer. Measured on an RTX 5070 (Windows, Q2_0): +4-5% decode, +7-10% on code and long
  documents. Answers can differ slightly from the default (they stay the same from run to run).
- **Faster prompt reading on Windows:** `"STRATA_PIN_BY_NEED": "1"` in the `"env"` block. Windows can lock only about
  half the RAM for the graphics card; this locks the experts the card actually needs first. Measured on the RTX 5070:
  +4.4% prompt reading.

```json
"args": [ ..., "--adapt-async", "1" ],
"env": { "STRATA_PIN_BY_NEED": "1" }
```

Restart AryaStrata (`START-HERE.bat` or `./setup.sh`) after the change. To undo, remove the two entries.

## How does it work?

The explanations and diagrams below come from original Strata and PolyStrata.
Their architecture is inherited by this fork; numerical examples and speedups
remain upstream observations unless included in our host report. Credit for the
original engineering and visuals belongs to those projects and their contributors.

Models like these usually run on servers with hundreds of gigabytes of graphics memory. Your graphics card has
8-32 GB. AryaStrata makes the model fit by **sharing the work across your whole PC**. Think of a kitchen: the things
you use all the time stay on the counter, and the rest waits in the pantry.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/how-it-works.svg" width="860" alt="The model's 24,576 experts: the busiest on the graphics card, all of them in RAM, a lookup table on the SSD"></p>

- **The model is a team of 24,576 small specialists ("experts").** Each word needs only 10 of them.
- **Your graphics card** keeps the few thousand experts that are used most often. **Your RAM** holds all of them,
  and **your processor** works on the rest at the same time. **Your SSD** holds a big lookup table.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/guess-and-check.svg" width="860" alt="A small helper guesses the next words; the big model checks them all at once and keeps the right ones"></p>

- **Guess, then check:** a small helper guesses the next few words. The big model checks them all at once. You get
  the same answer, 1.6-1.8x sooner.
- **Long texts are read in big pieces** (up to 8,192 tokens at a time), at over 1,000 tokens per second.

### GLM 5.3 Flash

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/how-it-works-glm.svg" width="860" alt="The model's 12,096 experts: the most used on the graphics card, the rest in RAM, the model's file on the SSD"></p>

- **The model is a team of 12,096 small experts**, 288 in each of 42 layers. Each word needs only 8 from every layer.
- **Your graphics card** keeps the ones used most often, about 2,470 of them on a 32 GB card: the engine counts which
  ones your work uses and chooses again at the next start. **Your RAM** holds the rest, and **your processor** runs
  them at the same time. **Your SSD** holds the model's file, which is used where it is, with no second copy; a start
  takes about 6 seconds once the file is in your RAM.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/guess-and-check-glm.svg" width="860" alt="A block of the model guesses the next words; the model checks them all at once and keeps the right ones"></p>

- **Guess, then check:** a block of the model made for guessing proposes the next few words. The model checks them all
  at once. You get the same answer, 1.1-1.2x sooner.
- **Long texts are read in big pieces** (1,024 tokens at a time, the experts the card does not hold passing through
  it), at 780 to 1,250 tokens per second.

### DeepSeek V4 Flash

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/how-it-works-dsv4.svg" width="860" alt="The model's 11,008 experts: the most used on the graphics card, the rest in RAM, the model's files on the SSD"></p>

- **The model is a team of 11,008 small experts**, 256 in each of 43 layers. Each word needs only 6 from every
  layer, beside one that every word uses.
- **Your graphics card** keeps the ones used most often, about 2,840 of them on a 32 GB card: the engine counts
  which ones your work uses. **Your RAM** holds the rest, and **your processor** runs them at the same time. **Your
  SSD** holds the model's files, which are used where they are, with no second copy.
- **A small memory of the conversation:** a word reads the last 128 words in full and the rest as compressed rows,
  one for every 4 or every 128 words. A token of context takes 6,880 bytes, so a long context leaves the card
  nearly all of its room for experts.
- **Long texts are read in big pieces** (1,024 tokens at a time), 30,000 tokens at about 1,000 tokens per second.
  It has no guess-then-check yet: the draft model made for it is not run.

- **The model is a team of 2,432 small experts**, 64 in each of 38 layers. Each word needs only 4 from every layer.
- **Most of its 40 layers have no attention.** 30 of them mix the words with a short convolution over the last three,
  which keeps two vectors a layer. Only the other 10 keep the whole conversation, so its memory of a conversation is
  small: a 128K context takes 2 GB more VRAM than 32K.
- **Your graphics card** keeps as many experts as fit: about 900 to 1,300 of them on an 8 GB card, all of them from
  24 GB on for the 4-bit sizes. On the 8 GB card the ones it holds serve two thirds to four fifths of what an answer
  uses. **Your RAM** holds the rest, and **your processor** runs them at the same time. **Your SSD** holds the
  model's file, which is used where it is, with no second copy.
- **No draft block.** The model has nothing that guesses ahead, so the engine guesses only from text the
  conversation repeats.
- **When the card holds every expert**, the whole step stays on the card: it routes the words to their experts and
  runs a token's 40 layers as one recorded launch.

- **The model is a team of 10,240 small experts**, 256 in each of 40 layers. Each word needs only 8 from every layer.
- **Your graphics card** keeps as many as fit: about 2,600 of them on an 8 GB card, all of them from 24 GB on. While
  it writes, the engine brings in the experts the answer keeps choosing, and on the 8 GB card the ones it holds serve
  about 60% of what an answer uses. **Your RAM** holds the rest, and **your processor** runs them at the same time.
  **Your SSD** holds the model's file, which is used where it is, with no second copy.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/guess-and-check-qwen36.svg" width="860" alt="The model's draft block guesses the next words; the model checks them all at once and keeps the right ones"></p>

- **Guess, then check:** the model's own draft block, which is in its file, proposes the next few words. The model
  checks them all at once. You get the same answer, 1.2-1.5x sooner.
- **Long texts are read in big pieces** (1,024 tokens at a time). When the card does not hold every expert, the others
  pass through it once for the whole prompt.

- **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B's architecture with other weights:** a team of 10,240 small experts, 256 in each of 40 layers, and
  only 8 of every layer for each word.
- **Your graphics card** keeps as many as fit: about 3,100 of them on an 8 GB card, all of them from 24 GB on. While
  it writes, the engine brings in the experts the answer keeps choosing, and on the 8 GB card the ones it holds serve
  about 60% of what an answer uses. **Your RAM** holds the rest, and **your processor** runs them at the same time.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/guess-and-check-ornith.svg" width="860" alt="The model's draft block guesses the next words; the model checks them all at once and keeps the right ones"></p>

- **Guess, then check:** its draft block is in its file too, and proposes the next few words. It guesses right less
  often than Qwen3.6-35B-A3B's, so you get the same answer 1.1-1.2x sooner.
- **Long texts are read in big pieces** (1,024 tokens at a time). When the card does not hold every expert, the others

- **The model is a team of 3,840 small experts**, 128 in each of 30 layers. Each word needs only 8 from every layer,
  beside a part of the layer that every word uses.
- **Your graphics card** keeps as many as fit: about 1,000 of them on an 8 GB card, all of them from 16 GB on by the
  installer's estimate. While it writes, the engine brings in the experts the answer keeps choosing, and on the 8 GB
  card the ones it holds serve about 55% of what an answer uses. **Your RAM** holds the rest, and **your processor**
  runs them at the same time. **Your SSD** holds the model's file and its draft model, which are used where they are,
  with no second copy.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/media/guess-and-check-gemma4.svg" width="860" alt="Google's small draft model guesses the next words; the model checks them all at once and keeps the right ones"></p>

- **Guess, then check:** Google's small draft model for it, a file of 0.5 GB that the installer downloads with the
  model, proposes the next few words. The model checks them all at once. You get the same answer, 1.3-1.6x sooner.
- **Long texts are read in big pieces** (1,024 tokens at a time). When the card does not hold every expert, the others

  the same time. **Your SSD** holds the model's file, which is used where it is, with no second copy.
- **One word at a time:** its file has no draft block, so nothing guesses ahead.
- **Pictures:** its own picture encoder reads a large picture as an overview and a few tiles. A screenshot of 1,200 by

## Support and contributing

For AryaStrata setup, integration or reproducibility problems, open an
[issue in this fork](https://github.com/KonnectSuite/AryaStrata/issues). Include
your OS, CPU, GPU/VRAM, RAM, model and quantization, engine version, context and
vision settings, reproduction steps, and relevant logs with secrets and private
prompts removed. Security reporting: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

- **Installation/downloads:** rerun `START-HERE.bat` or `./setup.sh` to resume; see [installation](docs/INSTALL.md).
- **Slow startup or memory pressure:** inspect the Monitor and engine log; close other memory-heavy apps or choose a smaller model. See [troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
- **Port 8080 unavailable:** check whether an existing server or another application owns it before restarting; see [troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
- **Model or hardware reports:** use [the benchmark procedure](docs/COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md#run-the-benchmark) and include exact settings and raw results.

Documentation evolves with evidence: keep inherited capabilities and attribution,
add measured host results beside them, and record limitations and regressions as
well as gains. Model support is qualified one configuration at a time. The
[upstream README snapshot](docs/UPSTREAM_README.md) preserves the fork-point text
for comparison; it supplements the current guide rather than replacing it.
